A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
Think of it like a line of people waiting to buy tickets at a movie theater â€“ the first person in line is the first to get the ticket.

Here are some key operations associated with a queue:

Enqueue: Adding an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Removing the element from the front of the queue.
Front (or Peek): Viewing the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checking if the queue is empty.
IsFull: Checking if the queue is full (in cases where a maximum size is defined).
